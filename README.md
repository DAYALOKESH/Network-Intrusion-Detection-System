Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are a critical security tool that monitors network traffic for malicious activity. Traditionally, NIDS relied on signature-based detection, which compares network packets to known attack patterns. However, with the evolving nature of cyber threats, Machine Learning (ML) offers a powerful approach for NIDS.
