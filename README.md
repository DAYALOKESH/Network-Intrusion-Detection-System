# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
---
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are a critical security tool that monitors network traffic for malicious activity. Traditionally, NIDS relied on signature-based detection, which compares network packets to known attack patterns. However, with the evolving nature of cyber threats, Machine Learning (ML) offers a powerful approach for NIDS.

- Since Every Dataset is bulky we are thinking of adapting Federated Learning along with CNN, SVM, and Random-Forest so that we can train the model simultaneously. ( Just a thought i and Josith had, hasn't been fixed yet )
